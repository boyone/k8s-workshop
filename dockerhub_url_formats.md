# 🔗 Understanding Docker Hub URLs

Docker Hub has different URL formats that serve different purposes. Here's a quick breakdown to understand what each one does:

---

## 1. `https://hub.docker.com/_/dockerhub_username`

### 🟢 Official Images

- The `_` signifies **official Docker images**.
- Maintained by Docker or trusted sources.
- Examples include `nginx`, `ubuntu`, `mysql`, etc.
- These do **not** require a username when pulling.

✅ **Example**:
```
https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
docker pull nginx
```

---

## 2. `https://hub.docker.com/u/dockerhub_username`

### 🧑‍💻 User Profile Page

- Displays the **public profile** for a Docker Hub user or organization.
- Shows all public repositories under that username.

✅ **Example**:
```
https://hub.docker.com/u/sckdev
```

---

## 3. `https://hub.docker.com/r/dockerhub_username`

### 📦 User Repositories

- Points to a **specific image repository** from a user.
- Shows details like tags, description, and pull instructions.

✅ **Example**:
```
https://hub.docker.com/r/sckdev/myapp
docker pull sckdev/myapp:latest
```
